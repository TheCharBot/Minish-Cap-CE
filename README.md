# Minish-Cap-CE
A Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap remake for the TI84 Plus CE 
  
  
Might update frequently, might not, I don't know.  
  
  
# Game Layout  
This game will be split into aroun 12 parts because of the lack of storage on the ti84.  
It will also probably have terrible code, because I am very new to C and the CEDev toolchain
